## 💡 Inspiration
We wanted to do something special for not only our own teachers, but everyone in the world who practices the noble profession of spreading knowledge and wisdom among young students. One important lesson taught by a teacher can impact students for the rest of their lives. Because of the critical role teachers play, it's important that they deliver the best lessons possible to their students. Keeping that in mind, we built iTeach for our teachers. 

## 💻 What it does
iTeach helps teachers create a greater impact on society by managing their tasks efficiently. Our teachers teach so many students every day, constantly conduct assignments, grade tests, manage office hours, develop lesson plans and overall, nurture minds with valuable lessons. They needed a tool which they can use to manage these tasks, prioritise what's important and help make a difference. While building this service for our teachers, we realised how hard our teachers work for the society, thus, we created an additional part of our service -- a teacher appreciation page; where students can share fond memories of their teachers and talk about their favorite teachers.

## ⚙️ How it works

## 🔨 How we built it
We used Figma to design the web app, and brought our design into reality through React - JS. Our service also uses HTML & CSS. We got an exposure to wonderful sponsor technologies and used them in our project -- namely, Google Cloud, GoDaddy & Twilio (more details given below). 

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud
- We built iTeach's authentication system with Google Cloud's Firebase. We chose this because we wanted to make an application that was very very secure. We learnt how robust & fast Google Cloud services are and seeing that Firebase had a free plan that was great for us student hackers, using Google Cloud was kind of a no brainer. Additionally, Firebase Authentication provided a backend service, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries, and the ability to authenticate using passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and the like. Thus, implementation was easy and we are pretty sure we made it incredibly convinient for our users, while keeping it secure. 
- We did the backend part of the graphs with Google Charts, a service we just discovered during the hackathon weekend. 

## ⭕ Use of Twilio
- We also developed a teacher appreciation page as mentioned earlier. This appreciation page utilises Twilio to send notifications to teachers when a particular student appreciates them. It helps teachers stay in touch with all their students. 

##  Use of GoDaddy
- We registered the following GoDaddy domains:

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
- The plugin we intended to use to convert Figma to HTML/CSS didn't work at all. So, we had to do it ourselves. 
- We were all new to Google Cloud technologies, but we quickly learnt how to use it.
- We were not able to do the task manager for teachers at first, but our team-mates worked extra hard (as late as 3AM in their time) and finally overcame it. 

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing a project that makes a difference in the lives of teachers. 
- Learning a lot: from workshops, sponsor technologies, competitors, MLHERS, and from each other. 
- Defeating the barriers put up by different timezones, and working extra hard to complete this project. 

## 📖 What we learned
- We learnt a lot about Firebase and Twilio: went through their neat documentation and we were glad to be able to use their services in our hackathon project. 
- We learnt the importance of collaboration.
- We also learnt how hard our teachers work in the process. 

## 🚀 What's next for iTeach
- We plan to refine the user experience and improve our service based on the feedback of teachers around the world.
