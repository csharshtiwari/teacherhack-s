## 💡 Inspiration
We wanted to do something special for not only our teachers, but everyone in the world who practices the noble profession of spreading knowledge and wisdom among young students. One important lesson taught by a teacher can impact students for the rest of their lives. Because of the critical role teachers play, it's important that they deliver the best lessons possible to their students. Keeping that in mind, we built iTeach for our teachers.
